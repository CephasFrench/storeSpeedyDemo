This program takes in a vmstoretext_readable.txt file and makes a storedata.txt file that contains all the information needed for the path solver

optimizations:
 - make it so that the storedata.txt is more organized or easyer to parse for the path solver so cut down on runtime data
 
useage:
 - the server program needs to (eventual) rename this file to the name of the store.
